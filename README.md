# Healthcare_PersistencyDrug
Data Science:: Healthcare - Persistency of a drug

## Problem Statement:

One of the challenge for all Pharmaceutical companies is to understand the persistency of drug as per the physician prescription. To solve this problem ABC pharma company approached an analytics company to automate this process of identification.

## ML Problem:

With an objective to gather insights on the factors that are impacting the persistency, build a classification for the given dataset.

**Target Variable:** Persistency_Flag

## Task:

* Problem understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Cleaning and Feature engineering
* Model Development
* Model Selection
* Model Evaluation
* Report the accuracy, precision and recall of both the class of target variable
* Report ROC-AUC as well
* Deploy the model
* Explain the challenges and model selection
